This was my first react project that i developed throught a Udemy course.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
